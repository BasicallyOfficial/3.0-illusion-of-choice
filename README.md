This is my small game that attempts to exercise what it means to have free will. Asking the question of what free will is, and if it is something that we truly have control over.

## **Project Timeline**

### Functional Gamestate

By 4/17 I hope to have working gamestates that make the game playable at the bare essentials

By 4/20 I hope to have the visual elements and style of the software laid out on top of the already established framework

### Finishing Touches

By 4/27 I will have made the finishing touches and fixes to the Project and it will be considered completed
